Cronof 2
========
(aka Quickgame)

A 2-D car racing game in Java. The gameplay is loosely inspired by [Micro Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_%28video_game_series%29).

Can be played online at [tinyurl.com/cronof2](http://tinyurl.com/cronof2). Rumours say that the URL was randomly chosen by tinyurl and eventually became the name of this game.

The original version was coded in one day, but over time lots of features were added.
